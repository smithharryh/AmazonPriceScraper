# Amazon Price Scraper

I recently bought some new headphones full price and then Amazon discounted them a couple of days later ðŸ¥². I have free returns for three months and want to check the amazon  price to see if it gets to the point where its worth me going to the store to return them and get them from Amazon.

So I made a super simple scraper project running on crontab to scrape amazon and get the current price of my headphones every hour.

Next i'll get it to  email  me if the price dips below my "efficiency  point".
